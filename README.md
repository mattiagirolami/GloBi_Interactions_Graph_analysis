# Biotic Interactions Graph Analysis

The entire project was carried out in collaboration with my colleague Gianmarco Fiorenza.

## Project Overview

This project aims to study the properties of a graph of biotic interactions. The dataset was obtained using RGlobi and contains interactions between species in the European territory. The analysis performed on the graph includes the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
2. **Degree Distribution Analysis**
3. **Community Detection and Analysis**
4. **Graph Centrality Metrics Analysis**
5. **Verification of Hierarchical and/or Fractal Structure of the Graph**
6. **Multilayer Graph Analysis (divided by type of interaction)**

## Analysis Details

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and general properties.

### 2. Degree Distribution Analysis
Study of the degree distribution of the graph to understand how connections are spread among the nodes.

### 3. Community Detection and Analysis
Division of the graph into communities and examination of the properties and interactions within and between these communities.

### 4. Graph Centrality Metrics Analysis
Analysis of various centrality metrics to identify the most important nodes within the graph.

### 5. Verification of Hierarchical and/or Fractal Structure of the Graph
Investigation to determine if the graph exhibits a hierarchical or fractal structure.

### 6. Multilayer Graph Analysis
Analysis of the graph in a multilayer style, where layers represent different types of interactions between species.
